# admin/

Admin console (admin.todayz.in; locally https://admin.todayz.localhost). Desktop-first; field-agent pages responsive. RBAC with 7 roles.

Read first: the root `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/plan/README.md`, `docs/plan/01-product-rules.md`, then 02-architecture.md §3.3, §4.1, §4.4; 06-screens.md (A-xx); 01-product-rules.md.

## Run

- `make dev`, then open https://admin.todayz.localhost
- `pnpm --filter @todayz/admin test` / `build`

## Rules for this folder

- Import only from `shared/*` and `design/`, never from a sibling app.
- Every list is server-paginated with filters in the URL; every mutation shows the audit side panel.
- Tokens only, no raw hex; light theme only; i18n keys for all text.
- Never show a provider key value; integrations show set/missing only.

## Status

Stub from W0-01. The WP that builds this folder fills in layout and conventions.
